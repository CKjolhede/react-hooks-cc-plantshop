Question 5
1 / 1 pts
A React function component must start with a capital letter.
  True 
Correct! React differentiates between a component and a regular DOM element based on capitalization. For example, making an `` component with a lowercase name wouldn't work:

function article() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>React</h1>
      <p>Component</p>
    </div>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<article />, document.getElementById("root"));
Trying to render this component would result in React rendering an`` HTML elementLinks to an external site.instead of the `` component.

Using an uppercase name for the function fixes this problem:

function Article() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>React</h1>
      <p>Component</p>
    </div>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<Article />, document.getElementById("root"));
  False

IncorrectQuestion 6
0 / 1 pts
Given the following code, what would appear in the console?

function Parent() {
  const header = "Hello";
  const contents = "World";

  return <Child title={header} body={contents} minutesToRead={10} />;
}

function Child(props) {
  console.log(props);
  // ... return JSX
}
  I don't know.
  
{
  header: "Hello",
  contents: "World",
  minutesToRead: 10
}
Not quite. The keys on the props object are based on the attributes assigned by the parent component, which in this case are title, body, andminutesToRead.
  
{
  title: "Hello",
  body: "World",
  minutesToRead: 10
}
  
{
  title: "header",
  body: "contents",
  minutesToRead: 10
}

IncorrectQuestion 9
0 / 1 pts
When should you use the key prop?
  I don't know.
  When rendering an array of components. 
  Any time .map is used in a component.
Not quite. The key prop is a special prop that React uses to help optimize performance when rendering arrays of components. While we often use thekeyprop when using .map to create an array of components, just using .mapin a component isn't enough to indicate the need for the key prop.
  If two components are siblings.

IncorrectQuestion 11
0 / 1 pts
The following is a valid React component:

function App() {
  return (
    <Article />
    <Comment />
  );
}
  Yes 
A component can only return one element. We'd need to wrap the returned components in an enclosing tag or aFragmentLinks to an external site. like this to make it valid:

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Article />
      <Comment />
    </div>
  );
}
  False
